//variables are storage locations. They store data that is later retrieved by a function. Variables store data in by using values.
//An example of a variable would be something like:
{
    int myInt = 5;

    void Start(){
        myInt = MultiplyByTwo(myInt);
        Debug.Log (myInt);
    }
}
//Computer programming uses iteration alot. We refrence back to data before stated to be used later.

//A subroutine is in the most basic sense a string of program plans that enact a certian task. These are most often bundeled together as a unit. 
//Once packaged into a unit a subroutine can be used in programs. 
//These may be defined in programs or in seperate libraries. 
//They are also usable with multiple programs. 
//Last of all, these subroutines are labeled different depending on the coding language itself. 

//Now that we have described what our car is, we can use a function to make it do something. 
// An exampe would be:
int MultiplyByTwo(myInt){
    int ret;

    ret = number * 2;

    return ret;
} //<-- This outputs the value of ret
//<-- The results of this running would be 10 because its 5 multiplied by 2
